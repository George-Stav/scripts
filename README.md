# shell-scripts
A collection of simple shell scripts that assist the user in their day-to-day linux activities.

## Usage

The `link-scripts.sh` file in the top directory creates symbolic links of all the scripts in the `./scripts/` directory to `/usr/bin/`.

If the latter already contains any scripts by the same name, they will be replaced.
