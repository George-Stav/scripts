# shell-scripts
A collection of simple shell scripts that assist the user in their day-to-day linux activities.

## Usage

The `apply-scripts.sh` file in the top directory removes the `.sh` extension from the scripts and copies them into the `/usr/bin/` directory. 

If the latter already contains any scripts by the same name, they will be replaced.
